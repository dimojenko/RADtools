## Rename PDF GUI
This is a Windows GUI for renaming scans of test case documents with the accepted naming scheme.
The user will be asked for a PDF file or multiple files to rename. The program then reads in 
those PDFs and extracts the test case number which is used to find the proper name for that
particular test case. Then the PDFs are renamed accordingly in their original location.

The entire /renamePDFgui/ folder will need to be downloaded. However, to run the program, only
the executable (.exe) needs to be run or double-clicked.
